Forecast use of a city bikeshare system (from Kaggle) "solved" with R Studio:

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

My approach was to use R studio and do data exploration using descriptive statistics. Once I had handle the data, I did feature engineering. Then, I used machine learning to make the forcasting, with at the beginning, a linear regression (not good results), so I improved my model using randomForest and rforest.
